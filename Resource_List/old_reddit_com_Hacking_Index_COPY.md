Welcome to [/r/hacking](https://old.reddit.com/r/hacking)!

A subreddit dedicated to hacking and hacking culture.

What we are about: quality and constructive discussion about the culture, profession and love of hacking.

This sub is aimed at those with an understanding of hacking - please visit **[/r/HowToHack](https://old.reddit.com/r/HowToHack)** for posting beginner links and tutorials; any beginner questions should be directed there as they will result in a ban here.

Guides and tutorials are welcome here as long as they are suitably complex and most importantly legal!

Please don't post illegal stuffs. Bans are handed out at moderator discretion.

---

# Rules

1.  **Keep it legal**. Hacking can be a grey area but keep it above board. Discussion around the legality of issues is ok, encouraging or aiding illegal activities is not.
2.  We are not your personal army. This is not the place to try to find hackers to do your dirty work and you will be banned for trying. This includes: Asking someone to hack for you, trying to hire hackers, asking for help with your DoS, asking how to get into your "girlfriend's" instagram, and offering to do these things will also result in a ban.
3.  No "how do i start hacking?" posts. See [/r/howtohack](https://old.reddit.com/r/howtohack) or the stickied post. Intermediate questions are welcomed - e.g. "How does HSTS prevent SSL stripping?" is a good question. "How do I hack wifi with Kali?" is bad.
4.  No "I got hacked" posts unless it's an interesting post-mortem of a unique attack. Your nan being phished doesn't count.
5.  Sharing of personal data is forbidden - no doxxing or IP dumping.
6.  Spam is strictly forbidden and will result in a ban. Professional promotion e.g. from security firms/pen testing companies is allowed within the confines of site-wide rules on self promotion [found here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion), but will otherwise be considered spam.
7.  Off-topic posts will be treated as spam.
8.  Low-effort content will be removed at moderator discretion.
9.  We are not tech support, these posts should be kept on [/r/techsupport](https://old.reddit.com/r/techsupport).
10.  Don't be a dick. Play nice, support each other and encourage learning.

# FAQ

## Beginning & Basics to hacking

> **How do I start hacking?**

Hacking is an incredibly broad topic.There's is no single "hacking" action. You will need to describe **what** you want to learn. [This post will help you define hacking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/2ru1oq/meta_how_to_ask_questions_about_hacking/) From there, check out resources related to the areas of hacking you are interested in.

Past Threads:

-   [What are some educational tools to become a white hat hacker for a beginner?](https://old.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/sy1dy7/what_are_some_educational_tools_to_become_a_white/)

> **Where should I start?**

Again, [narrow down](http://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/2ru1oq/meta_how_to_ask_questions_about_hacking/) what you want to learn. There is simply too much in the wide world of hacking to not narrow it down. Here are a few resources that provide a good general basis:

-   _Hacking: the art of exploitation_ ([amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593271441)) - General overview of hacker mentality and basic exploitation techniques
    
-   _Violent Python_ ([amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597499579)) - Using basic python skills to create powerful tools for offence and defence.
    
-   _Web Application Hacker's Handbook_ ([amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118026470)) - Very in depth guide to website security and common vulnerabilities.
    
-   _Practical Malware Analysis_ ([amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593272901)) - This will teach you how to analyze malware thoroughly. Yes, it will teach you how malware is written and how malware authors think.

## History

### Reading & Culture

> Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers. "Teenager Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
> 
> Damn kids. They're all alike.
> 
> But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker? Did you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
> 
> I am a hacker, enter my world...
> 
> Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
> 
> Damn underachiever. They're all alike.
> 
> I'm in junior high or high school. I've listened to teachers explain for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction. I understand it. "No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work. I did it in my head..."
> 
> Damn kid. Probably copied it. They're all alike.
> 
> I made a discovery today. I found a computer. Wait a second, this is cool. It does what I want it to. If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up. Not because it doesn't like me... Or feels threatened by me... Or thinks I'm a smart ass... Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
> 
> Damn kid. All he does is play games. They're all alike.
> 
> And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is found. "This is it... this is where I belong..." I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
> 
> Damn kid. Tying up the phone line again. They're all alike...
> 
> You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless. We've been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic. The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.
> 
> This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
> 
> Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.
> 
> I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto. You may stop this individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.
